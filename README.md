# Sad Story Generator
## A school project (Also known as the HAUK project because of my group)

### What is this?
A set of tools used to build a text generation. This includes a sever-side application, and interface to get text from the public, as well as the text generation software itself (WIP).

Note that this is not only limited to "sad stories". That comes from my group, again.

### How to use?
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/liam-ilan/sad-story-generator.git`
2. Init NPM: `npm init`
3. To start the server (for getting text), run: `npm start`
4. For linting, run: `npm run lint`
